## Pewlett Hackard Retirement Preparation Overview
In the coming years many of Pewlett Hackard's employees will begin to reach the age of retirement. As such, the company needs to make sure it is ready to fill the positions that will be vacated by retirees. 
## Pewlett Hackard Retirement Preparation Results
The first step was to determine who will be eligible to retire based on age. To do this a table was created to show employees who were born between 1952 and 1955. Next, these employees were narrowed down by department. This will give the company a better idea of what positions may become vacant in the near future. Here is a break-down of potential retirees by department:

* Senior Engineers and Senior Staff will account for nearly 50,000 vacancies
* A mentoership program of employees born in 1965 alone will no be enough to replace all those that could retire soon.
* If the mentorship program were extended to those born after 1965, there still will not be enough folks to fill those roles.
* Why? For some odd reason, this company doesn't have employees that were born after 1965.

In an attempt to increase the number of employees eligible for a mentorship program, a table was created where the age range was extended beyond those born in 1965. Surprisingly this was the exact same table as the one where 1965 was the cut off. Based on the employees csv, there are no employee that were born after 1965. This is likely because this is a fictional company with fictional data. But here is a glimpse of the new table created, you know, for the purpose of getting full credit for this assignment.

## Pewlett Hackard Retirement Preparation Summary

In summary, I recommend this company stop engaging in an apparent practice of age discrimination by not hiring anyone born after 1965. A mentorship program only works if there ia a pool of talent to draw from. With so many people retiring soon and no employees who were born after 1965, this company is doomed for sure. I suggest some major downsizing.
