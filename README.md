## Pewlett Hackard Retirement Preparation Overview
In the coming years many of Pewlett Hackard's employees will begin to reach the age of retirement.

To do this a table was created to show employees who were born between 1952 and 1955. Next, these employees were narrowed down by department. This will give the company a better idea of what positions may become vacant in the near future. Here is a break-down of potential retirees by department:
